# The Manga Storm Backup Translator via command line tool
Use this tool to turn your manga storm data into something useful. The data contains the web site, url, manga, (reading, archive and updated)
and some kind of hash number for determining the chapters that you have read and have not read. Feel free to go and edit my code as you can just 
grab the data from the double list in the class once you inzilize the class.


## How to use the command line
```bash
python msbf_Decoder.py <input file> <output file>
```
note that the input file will be the file that is the backup (*.msbf)
note for the output file it will overwirte anything of the same name or instantiate a new file if one does not exsiste

so be carful

Cheers and have fun?
